1.Data Preparation Steps: You've listed the data preparation steps, including loading the dataset, visualizing features, categorizing features, exploring data through EDA, and cleaning the data. It might be beneficial to include specific methods used for data cleaning, such as handling missing values, outliers, or encoding categorical variables.

2.Code Snippets for Data Loading, Splitting, and Model Building: The code snippets provided for loading data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and building models are clear and concise. However, it would be helpful to include comments explaining the rationale behind certain parameter choices, such as the selection of n_estimators in the Random Forest model.

3.Model Performance Evaluation: The evaluation metrics chosen (Mean Squared Error and R-squared) are appropriate for regression tasks. You could also consider including other evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for a more comprehensive assessment of model performance.

4.Conclusions and Insights: Your conclusions provide a clear comparison of model performance and highlight the superiority of the Random Forest model over SVR. It would be valuable to discuss potential reasons for the performance difference, such as the nature of the dataset, the complexity of the relationships between features and the target variable, or the inherent strengths of each algorithm.
